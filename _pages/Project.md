The application allows you to choose one of the pretrained architectures, specify different hyperparameters (learning rate, hidden layers, epochs) and use either GPU or CPU for training. I also implemented saving the checkpoints so that you can continue training if stopped. Image Classifier predicts 102 flower categories. "
