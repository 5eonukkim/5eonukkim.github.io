I'm an undergraduate student majoring in *[Industrial Engineering](https://ie.unist.ac.kr/eng/)* and *[Design](https://design.unist.ac.kr/)* at **[Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST)](https://www.unist.ac.kr/)**. Now, I'm an undergraduate intern at [Expressive Computing Lab, UNIST](https://www.klee141.com/). I love **manga & webtoon** and study **AI+X**, which is related to creative support tools for these works' support.
