### Hello, I'm Seonuk Kim! <br/> I'm traveling to find ways to create <span style="color:navy">manga & webtoon</span> easier and better with <span style="color:deepskyblue">AI</span>!

### About me
I'm an undergraduate student at **Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST)**, majoring in ***Industrial Engineering*** and double majoring in ***Design***. I'm an undergraduate intern in [Expressive Computing Laboratory, UNIST].  
I love **manga & webtoon**. So, I'm interested in **AI + X**, which is related to creative support tools for these works' support. I dream of an era where anyone can create content more easily using AI and freely turn their imaginations into reality.
