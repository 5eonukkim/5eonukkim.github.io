I'm an undergraduate student majoring in ***Industrial Engineering*** and ***Design*** at **Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST)**. I'm an undergraduate intern in [Expressive Computing Laboratory, UNIST]. I love **manga & webtoon**. So, I'm interested in **AI + X**, which is related to creative support tools for these works' support. I dream of an era where anyone can create content more easily using AI and freely turn their imaginations into reality.
